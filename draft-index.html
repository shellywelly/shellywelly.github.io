INTRO
What is your idea? My idea for this Imaginative Community project is to have a group to meet up every week and speak with kids about their life, goals, and things they wish to share with me. I also want to  give them gifts to uplift their spirit within them.
What is the mission? My mission is to make sure they leave our group knowing that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and to always know the group is compassionate and will always be there in time of emergencies or to confide in someone.
What is the vision? The vision is to have everyone that is involved in the group to strive for their goals and to have an open mind.
What is the tagline?
Why did this idea come to you? How is it in line with your passion, experience, interests? This idea came to mind when I thought about how much I love kids and giving them advice. This idea is in line with my interest in Pediatric Nursing.

BODY
What does the logistics of this idea look like?
Who does it serve? This program serves as uplifting patients and gives them something to look forward to. Staying in your bed all day will not give someone encouragement to keep moving.
How does it add value to the people/community itâ€™s serving?
What are the hours?
What sort of team/support/funding will this idea need?
